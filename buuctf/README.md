## Note

- This directory contains some ctf challenges from [buuctf](https://buuoj.cn/)

- The file `parse_args_and_some_func.py` is [here](https://github.com/RoderickChan/ctf_tasks/blob/main/buuctf/parse_args_and_some_func.py), Now I use [pwncli](https://github.com/RoderickChan/pwncli)

- The sequence here is random
- Mostly, the file `xxxx.bk` is the original file. When `xxxx.bk` exists, `xxxx` is the file I had patched using `patchelf`, so it would be broken in your environment
-  You can add other challenges from buuctf through a pull-request
